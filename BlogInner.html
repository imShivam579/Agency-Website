                      Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and
                      confusing, and sometimes we are unsure about how to get
                      the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at
                      Zeta Design wanted to build a Figma plugin for the larger
                      design community. The plugin is called the Ghost UXWriter
                      and has a set of UX copies cataloged and categorized with
                      a voice and tone variation ranging from plain, casual to
                      playful. The intention to build this Figma plugin
                      originated from our Medium blog post, ‘Designing voice and
                      tone for error messages.
